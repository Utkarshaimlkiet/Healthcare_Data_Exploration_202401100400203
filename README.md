Absolutely, Utkarsh! Here's a brief description of the code we have done:

Upload CSV File:

We start by uploading a CSV file to Google Colab using the files.upload() function from the google.colab module. This opens a file upload dialog to select and upload the CSV file containing patient data.

Import Libraries:

We import essential libraries: pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib.pyplot for creating plots, and seaborn for advanced data visualization.

Load CSV File into DataFrame:

We load the uploaded CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. The next(iter(uploaded)) is used to get the filename from the uploaded files dictionary.

Visualize Blood Pressure:

We create a line plot for blood pressure using Seaborn's sns.lineplot() function. The plot displays blood pressure measurements over different Patient IDs, with the x-axis representing Patient IDs and the y-axis representing blood pressure values in mmHg.

Visualize Sugar Levels:

We create another line plot for sugar levels using the sns.lineplot() function. This plot shows sugar level measurements over different Patient IDs, with the x-axis representing Patient IDs and the y-axis representing sugar levels in mg/dL.

Visualize Weight:

Lastly, we create a line plot for weight using the sns.lineplot() function. This plot displays weight measurements over different Patient IDs, with the x-axis representing Patient IDs and the y-axis representing weight values in kg.

Each plot includes a title, axis labels, and grid lines to enhance readability. This approach provides a clear visualization of patient data trends over time, helping to identify patterns and insights.
